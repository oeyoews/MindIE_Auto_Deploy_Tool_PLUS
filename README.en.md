# Ascend MindIE Multi-Node Cluster Inference Auto-Deployment Tool (Supporting Deepseek R1/V3 Full Version)

## Project Introduction

**Features:**
- Supports offline usage
- Supports Ascend multi-node/cluster deployment (currently does not support single-node deployment)
- Supports all MindIE-compatible models, not limited to DeepSeek v3/r1
- Fully automated deployment, estimated deployment time 5-10 minutes

> Note: The tool is frequently updated, bookmarking is recommended.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://modelers.cn/devincool/deepseekr1_671B_auto_deploy_tool.git
```

### 2. Prerequisites

The following resources are required before deployment:

1. **Drivers and Docker Image**
   - Download compatible drivers and mindie 2.0.T3/T3.1 docker image:
   - üëâ [mindie2.0.T3 Resource Package](https://modelers.cn/models/LiuZhiwen/mindie2.0.T3)

2. **Model Weights**
   - DeepSeek V3 (requires 4 nodes, 800I-A2-64G/800T-A2-64G):
   - üëâ [DeepSeek V3 Weights](https://modelers.cn/models/MindIE/deepseekv3)
   
   - DeepSeek R1-W8A8 (requires 2 nodes, 800I-A2-64G/800T-A2-64G):
   - üëâ [DeepSeek R1 Weights](https://modelers.cn/models/State_Cloud/DeepSeek-R1-bf16-hfd-w8a8)

> Note: There's a utility script `trans_quote_to_real.sh` in the lib directory that can be placed in the openmind_hub download cache path to convert symbolic links to real files for container use.

## Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Fully Automated Deployment (Recommended)

#### 1. Configure Deployment Parameters
Edit the `deploy_config.json` file:

> Note: Number of nodes must be a power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8...)

```json
{
    "master_ip": "192.168.1.100",        # Master node IP
    "nodes": [                           # List of all node IPs (including master)
        "192.168.1.100",
        "192.168.1.101",
        "192.168.1.102",
        "192.168.1.103"
    ],
    "model_name": "deepseekr1",         # Model name
    "model_path": "/model/deepseekr1_w8a8", # Model path in container, must be accessible via volumes mount
    "world_size": 32,                   # Total number of devices
    "docker": {
        "image": "your_mindie_image_id", # Mindie Docker image ID
        "volumes": {                     # Docker volume mount configuration
            "/data/model": "/model",    # /data/model is host directory, /model is container mount point
        }
    },
    "ssh": {                            # SSH connection configuration
        "username": "root",             # SSH username
        "use_key": true,               # Whether to use key authentication
        "key_path": "~/.ssh/id_rsa",   # SSH key path
        "password": "",                 # Password if not using key authentication
        "port": 22                     # Custom SSH port if modified
    }
}
```

#### 2. Execute Deployment

1. Prepare Configuration File
   ```bash
   # Copy and modify config file
   cp deploy_config.json.example deploy_config.json
   vim deploy_config.json
   ```

> Note: After configuration, copy the tool package to all nodes, deployment script needs to be executed on each machine.

2. Execute Deployment
   ```bash
   # Start deployment
   bash deploy.sh
   ```

3. Clean Environment
   ```bash
   # Clean up previous containers and processes
   bash deploy.sh --cleanup
   ```

**Deployment Process:**
1. ‚úÖ Check network environment
2. ‚úÖ Generate rank table configuration
3. ‚úÖ Launch Docker containers
4. ‚úÖ Configure environment variables
5. ‚úÖ Modify Mindie service configuration
6. ‚úÖ Execute memory warmup
7. ‚úÖ Start service

**Important Notes:**
- Master node must start service first
- Worker nodes must start within 1 minute after master node
- Please confirm successful execution of each step as prompted

#### Automated Deployment Tool FAQ

1. **Script reports master_ip field not found**
   ```bash
   # Check if jq tool is properly installed
   jq -h
   
   # If jq is not installed, install using:
   # Ubuntu/Debian:
   apt-get update && apt-get install jq
   
   # CentOS/RHEL:
   yum install jq
   ```

2. **Script reports pip package installation failure**
   The pre-packaged pip packages are paramiko and its dependencies, which may not be compatible with different OS/Python versions. Please install manually.
   ```bash
   # Install paramiko and dependencies
   pip install paramiko -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
   ```
   Then comment out the paramiko-related pip installation lines in deploy.sh script.

3. **Service reports error after startup**
   Follow these troubleshooting steps:
   ```bash
   # 1. Enter docker container
   docker exec -it xxxx bash
   
   # 2. Enter service directory
   cd /usr/local/Ascend/mindie/latest/mindie-service/
   ```
   
   Log file locations:
   - Service logs: `output_xxx.log` in current directory
   - Operator library logs: `~/atb/log`
   - Acceleration library logs: `~/mindie/log/debug`
   - MindIE LLM logs: `~/mindie/log/debug`
   - MindIE Service logs: `~/mindie/log/debug`

### Method 2: Semi-Automated Deployment (Optional)

For finer control, follow these manual steps:

#### 1. Check Network Environment
```bash
./lib/auto_check.sh
```

#### 2. Generate Rank Table Configuration
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 lib/generate_ranktable_semiauto.py
```

> Note:
> - Generated rank_table_file.json needs to be manually placed at /usr/local/Ascend/mindie/latest/mindie-service/rank_table_file.json in container
> - Script requires SSH access to all servers, supports both password and key authentication:
>   - Choose "y" for key authentication if SSH keys are configured
>   - Choose "N" for password authentication otherwise

**Following operations are performed in docker container, deepseekr1 requires mindie2.0.t3 version docker image:**
#### 3. Configure Environment Variables
```bash
./lib/add_env_settings.sh <master_ip> <container_ip> <world_size>
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### 4. Modify Mindie Service Configuration
```bash
python3 lib/modify_mindie_config_semiauto.py
```

#### 5. Memory Warmup (Optional)
```bash
cd $MODEL_PATH
nohup bash lib/push_mem.sh > output_mem.log &
```

#### 6. Start Service
```bash
cd /usr/local/Ascend/mindie/latest/mindie-service/
nohup ./bin/mindieservice_daemon > output_$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M").log 2>&1 &
```

## Important Notes

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure all scripts have execution permissions
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Verify correct master_ip and world_size values before executing add_env_settings.sh
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è SSH access to all servers is required for rank table generation
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Memory warmup may take considerable time, please be patient
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Execute steps in order to ensure correct configuration

## Common Issues

1. **SSH Connection Failure**
   - Verify username and server IP address
   - Confirm SSH service is running on target machine
   - Verify authentication method (key/password)
   
2. **Permission Issues**
   - Ensure scripts have execution permissions

3. **Environment Variables Not Taking Effect**
   - Remember to execute `source ~/.bashrc`

4. **Network Check Failure**
   - Check network connectivity and NPU device status
   - Review service logs
   - Confirm port availability
